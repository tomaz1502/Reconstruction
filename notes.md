- Syntax -> Name : getId
- Name -> Syntax ?


# Ideas
 - Make the tactics have a separate auxiliary function to return the actual proof term
   so we don't have to use evalTactic and keep refreshing the context
 - Create a core for each tactic so that we don't have to use it with Syntax,
   but with sets of Expr/Name (easier to manipulate)

# TODO
 - factoring tactic (remove duplicates in or-chain)
 - fix bug in resolution (if the resolvant itself is an Or)
 - rewrite everything using option 2 from Wojciech (manipulate
   syntax instead of expr)
